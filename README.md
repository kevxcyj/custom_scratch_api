Custom Scratch API

About the Developer

Hi, I’m [Your Name], a full-stack developer with a strong passion for building clean, scalable, and user-friendly web applications. I enjoy blending creativity with problem solving — from making fun frontend projects to building APIs that power them.

This project showcases my backend development skills — focusing on API design, data modeling, and making services that are easy to use and extend.

- Project Description -

Custom Scratch API is a Node.js & Express-based API designed to support CRUD operations with a modular and scalable structure. It integrates with a database, leverages Swagger for API documentation, and is structured with a clean MVC pattern for maintainability.

This project started as a way to practice API design and documentation while also experimenting with more advanced backend workflows, authentication, and data handling.

- Development Story -

The idea for this project came from wanting to create an API that mimics real-world production standards — something that’s not just functional but also well-structured, documented, and scalable.

I began by setting up Express.js and a modular folder structure (routes, models, scripts).

I incorporated Swagger.json for auto-generated documentation so users can explore the API easily.

Along the way, I refined my use of environment variables (.env) and database handling.

The project was both a learning ground and a portfolio piece to showcase backend design.

- Features Implemented -

RESTful API endpoints with Express.js

MVC architecture for clean separation of concerns

Swagger documentation (swagger.json)

Database integration (config in /db)

Environment variable support via .env

- Features to Add -

Authentication & authorization (JWT)

Advanced query filtering and pagination

Unit & integration tests

Deployment to cloud hosting (Heroku / Render / Vercel)

- Biggest Challenges -

Designing a scalable folder structure while keeping code readable and modular

Debugging API routes when connecting to the database

Learning how to integrate Swagger documentation smoothly with Express
